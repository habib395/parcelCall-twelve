6. **How to Run the Project Locally**

- **Clone the repositories**:  
  ```bash
  git clone [client-side-repo-link]  
  git clone [server-side-repo-link]

  # Install dependencies for the client-side
cd client  
npm install  

# Install dependencies for the server-side
cd ../server  
npm install  

# Firebase credentials
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# MongoDB URI (for the server)
MONGO_URI=your-mongo-uri

# Any other necessary environment variables

# Start the client-side development server
npm start # For the client  

# Start the server-side development server
npm run dev # For the server  


### Explanation:
1. **Cloning Repositories**: The user will need to clone both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) repositories.
2. **Installing Dependencies**: Each repository will have its own dependencies, so the user needs to run `npm install` in both the `client` and `server` directories.
3. **Environment Variables**: The user must set up a `.env` file for both the client and server to store credentials like Firebase API keys, MongoDB URI, etc.
4. **Starting the Servers**: The client and server are run using `npm start` and `npm run dev` commands, respectively.
5. **Live Links**: Provide links to the live project and GitHub repositories so that users can access the resources and deployed site.
6. **Credentials for Admin & Delivery Men**: You can add default test credentials to assist the user in logging into the app.

Replace the placeholders like `[client-side-repo-link]` and `[server-side-repo-link]` with your actual links and relevant details.
